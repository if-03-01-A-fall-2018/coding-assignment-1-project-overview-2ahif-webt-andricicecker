        <h2>Here we are briefly summarized, all new innovations of the car industry explain.</h2>
        <p>Nowadays most new cars can take over a certain distance themselves and master it accordingly well.</p>
        <p>But it was still not the complete route without interruptions managed.</p>

        <h2>First Steps</h2>
        <p>Since 1920, people started to experiment with cars <br> to drive it without any help of a human, but promising results of this experiments took at least 30 years.</p>
        <p>The first truly automated car was developed in 1977, by the Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Laboratory in Japan.But the first autonomous prototype car appeard in the 1980s.</p>

        <h2>DARPA Grand Challenge</h2>
        <p>From the 1960s up through the second DARPA Grand Challenge in 2005, automated vehicle research in the U.S. was primarily funded by DARPA, the US Army and the U.S. Navy yielding incremental advances in speeds, driving competence in more complex conditions, controls, and sensor systems. Since then, numerous companies and research organizations have developed prototypes.</p>

        <h2>Interest of the state</h2>
        <p>The U.S. Congress allocated $650 million in 1991 for research on the Nation Automated Highway System, which demonstrated automated driving through a combination of automation embedded in the highway with automated technology in vehicles and cooperative networking between the vehicles and with the highway infrastructure.</p>

        <h2>Cars without driver</h2>
        <p>In 2017, Audi stated that its latest A8 would be automated at speeds of up to 60 kilometres per hour using its Audi AI. 
        <p>In November 2017, Waymo announced that it had begun testing driverless cars without a safety driver in the driver position however there is still an employee in the car. In July 2018, Waymo announced that its test vehicles had travelled in automated mode for over 8,000,000 miles, increasing by 1,000,000 miles per month.</p>
